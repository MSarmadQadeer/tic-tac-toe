# tic-tac-toe

In semester 1, Dr. Majid Iqbal taught us python. After teaching us the **if statement**, he told us to create a tic-tac-toe game by using the **if statement only**.

When he taught us the **elif - else**, he told us to induce **elif - else** into it.

When he taught us the **loops**, he told us to induce **loops** into the game.

At last, he told us to induce a random toss into the game. Either the computer goes first or the user goes first.

That's why there are different versions of the game. :sparkles:

### note

I think I converted my game with **if statement only** into the game with **if - elif - else**. That's why I did not have the game with **if statement only**. And in the first semester, I was unaware of the power of git. Otherwise, I would surely have the game with **if statement only**.
